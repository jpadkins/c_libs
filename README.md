# c_libs

These are some reusable and lightweight utilities for C99 I have extracted from projects over the years. So far this includes:

[jp_log](jp_log.h) - An API for logging to stdout/stderr with some configuration options.

[jp_vector](jp_vector.h) - A type-generic API for managing dynamic arrays.

Please feel free to open any issues if you find them, as that would help me out a ton. Enjoy!
